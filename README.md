- ⚡ Fun fact: From ChatGPT re our name:
1.  **Cogni-**: This prefix is derived from the Latin word "cognitio," which means "knowledge" or "cognition." It's related to the act of knowing, understanding, and perceiving.
In the context of AI, it suggests an emphasis on cognitive abilities, such as learning, understanding, and intelligent processing.
3. **Virtus**: This is a Latin word that carries meanings of virtue, excellence, courage, and worth.
In historical contexts, "virtus" was a quality combining valor, manliness, excellence, courage, character, and worth, admired as a virtue in classical Roman culture.

Combining these two, **CogniVirtus** embodies advanced cognitive abilities but also excels in its field, demonstrating superior qualities, much like the virtues extolled in classical times.
It suggests an AI that is not just intelligent, but also exemplary in its capabilities and ethical in its operations.
