        <h1>Our first product, the <a href="./Products/architectureCopilot.html">Architecture Copilot</a> GPT Has just been released!</h1>
        You can check it out <a href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-iHXlDzolq-architecture-copilot">here</a> if you have a <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus">Chat GPT Plus</a> subscription.
        <h3>Vision</h3>
        Architecture Copilot will be the next generation of Architectural Modelling Tool - built from the ground up with AI, rather than an existing tool "Now with added AI".
        <br>
        We have a roadmap that we'll be revealing soon, but obvious next steps will include improved persistence with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_database">Vector Databases</a> and the use of <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introduction-to-llm-agents/">Agents</a>.

        But that's not all... We eat our own dogfood and are using a Lean Startup and Design Thinking approach, so there will be more products coming soon. Everything will start as MVP and then progress (or not) based on <b>your</b> feedback and demand.
